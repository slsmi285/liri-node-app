# liri-node-app
LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI.  However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _language_Interpretation and Recognition Interface.  LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.  LIRI will search Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies.

Instructions:

Open your terminal or command program
Navigate to the file path where the LIRI app contents are located on your computer
Type in one of the following commands
spotify-this-song + your desired song choice

Will search Spotify and pull a list of songs with or close to the song title entered.

movie-this + your desired movie choice

Will search OMDB and pull relevant information regarding movie inputted in search.

concert-this + your desired artist choice

Will search Bands in Town and pull a list of concert dates for selected artist if they have any coming up.

LIRI loves attention and is a free spirit so if you don't give him anything to search, he'll do his own thing! So show LIRI some love and get started NOW! Happy searching ;)
